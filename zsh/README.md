# ZSH Dotfiles :nerd_face:

## Introduction :blue_book:
This are my personal zsh dotfiles, which bring together several tools and external libraries to join them in a single configuration folder.
The dotfiles use:
- from [Nathaniel Landau](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/)
- [Mac Commandline Utilities](https://hackernoon.com/macbook-my-command-line-utilities-f8a121c3b019)
- [NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
- [Pyglet Fonts](https://pyglet.org)
- [Powerlevel9k for Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k)

## Install :wrench:
```

Run the install command. WARNING: the script uses sudo and other sensitive commands, please use at your own discretion.
```bash
